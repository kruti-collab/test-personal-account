1. **Root Cause Archaeological Dig**
   - Trace the problem to its fundamental origins
   - Map all contributing factors and their relationships
   - Identify systemic vs. symptomatic issues
   - Understand historical context and evolution

2. **Stakeholder Ecosystem Mapping**
   - Primary, secondary, and tertiary stakeholders
   - Conflicting interests and alignment opportunities
   - Power dynamics and decision-making flows
   - Success criteria from multiple perspectives

### Phase 2: Solution Architecture Exploration
3. **Pattern Mining and Innovation**
   - Survey industry patterns and anti-patterns
   - Identify novel approaches and emerging trends
   - Consider cross-domain solution transplants
   - Generate orthogonal solution vectors

4. **Constraint Optimization Analysis**
   - Hard vs. soft constraints identification
   - Constraint relaxation possibilities
   - Multi-objective optimization trade-offs
   - Pareto frontier exploration

### Phase 3: Implementation Pathway Design
5. **Evolutionary Strategy Planning**
   - Multiple pathway exploration (not just one approach)
   - Incremental vs. revolutionary change analysis
   - Adaptation and pivot strategies
   - Feedback loop and learning mechanisms

6. **Risk and Uncertainty Management**
