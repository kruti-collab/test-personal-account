Think carefully about: $ARGUMENTS

Please approach this systematically by:

1. **Understanding the Problem**
   - What exactly needs to be solved?
   - What are the constraints and requirements?
   - What context is important?

2. **Analysis**
   - Break down the problem into smaller components
   - Consider different approaches
   - Identify potential challenges

3. **Solution Planning**
   - Outline a clear approach
   - Consider implementation steps
   - Think through edge cases

4. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Provide specific, actionable recommendations
   - Consider best practices for this project
   - Account for existing codebase patterns

Take your time to think through this thoroughly before providing recommendations.
