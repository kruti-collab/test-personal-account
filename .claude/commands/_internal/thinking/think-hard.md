Think very carefully and deeply about: $ARGUMENTS

Please conduct an intensive analysis using this comprehensive framework:

## 🧠 Deep Problem Analysis

1. **Multi-Dimensional Problem Decomposition**
   - Core problem statement and variations
   - Hidden assumptions and implicit requirements
   - Stakeholder perspectives and use cases
   - Technical, business, and user impact dimensions

2. **Comprehensive Context Mapping**
   - Current system state and architecture
   - Historical decisions and their rationale
   - Future roadmap considerations
   - External dependencies and constraints

3. **Solution Space Exploration**
   - Generate multiple distinct approaches
   - Analyze trade-offs for each approach
   - Consider both obvious and creative solutions
   - Evaluate implementation complexity vs. benefit

4. **Risk and Impact Assessment**
   - Technical risks and mitigation strategies
   - Performance implications
   - Security considerations
   - Maintenance and scalability impacts

5. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Phased rollout approach
   - Testing and validation strategies
   - Rollback and contingency plans
   - Resource and timeline estimates

## 🔍 Meta-Analysis
- Are there alternative problem framings?
- What am I potentially missing?
- How does this fit into broader project goals?

Take significant time to explore this problem space thoroughly. Consider edge cases, alternative perspectives, and long-term implications before providing detailed recommendations.
